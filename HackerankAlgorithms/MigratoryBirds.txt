Given an array of bird sightings where every element represents a bird type id, determine the id of the most frequently sighted type. If more than 1 type has been spotted that maximum amount, return the smallest of their ids

def migratoryBirds(arr):
    # Write your code here
    types = { 
        '1': 0,
        '2': 0,
        '3': 0,
        '4': 0,
        '5': 0
    } 
    
    for s in arr:
        if s == 1:
            types['1'] += 1
        elif s == 2:
            types['2'] += 1
        elif s == 3:
            types['3'] += 1
        elif s == 4:
            types['4'] += 1
        elif s == 5:
            types['5'] += 1
    
    highest_sighting = max(types.values())
    most_sighted = [key for key, value in types.items() if value == highest_sighting]
    min_type = min(most_sighted)
    
    return int(min_type)
